## Major Accomplishments Today

### System Setup (Grant at laptop, ~16:00-18:00 EST)
- **Passwordless sudo granted** — `sudo -n true` works permanently
- **VS Code 1.109.4 installed** — `/snap/bin/code --no-sandbox`
- **xdotool + scrot + xclip installed** — desktop automation + screenshots now functional
- **SSH keypair generated** — `~/.ssh/id_oc6`, distributed fleet-wide by OC5
- **GNOME keyring permanently masked** — service + socket → /dev/null; PAM entries cleaned from lightdm + common-session
- **WiFi power save disabled** — Whitmer connection: powersave=2 (disable), permanent
- **x11vnc converted to systemd service** — Restart=always, auto-recovers
- **ngrok converted to systemd service** — Restart=always, auto-recovers
- **Linger enabled** — user session survives without active display
- **Clamshell 24/7 mode** — lid close = no suspend, no disconnect
- **Lock screen / DPMS** — fully disabled, xset timeout=0

### Fleet SSH Access — 6/6 Confirmed
- Kit 0 VPS: `root@10.10.0.1` (also `root@72.60.118.54`)
- OC2 ProBook: `thewindstorm@10.10.0.2`
- OC3 Latitude: `sneakyfree@10.10.0.3` ← DIFFERENT USERNAME, easy to forget
- OC4 ThinkCentre: `thewindstorm@10.10.0.4`
- OC5 iMac: `thewindstorm@10.10.0.5`
- OC7 x360: `thewindstorm@10.10.0.8`
- SSH config at `~/.ssh/config` — pre-configured with correct users

### AntiGravity / Clone Heaven
- Live at `http://10.10.0.6:8000` (Veron via WireGuard)
- FastAPI/Uvicorn — "Clone Heaven v1.0.0 — The world's shopping place for time with AI clones"
- API health: database ✅, Redis ⚠️ (minor ping attribute bug, non-critical)
- Swagger docs: `http://10.10.0.6:8000/docs`
- No SSH to Veron yet (key not in their authorized_keys)

### Browser/Automation Capabilities
- Playwright v1.58.2 + Chromium headless: fully operational
- playwright-extra + stealth plugin: installed
- System Chrome + Firefox: both available
- xdotool: can inject mouse clicks and keystrokes
- scrot: desktop screenshots working
- xclip: clipboard automation

### Restart Test — PASSED
- Rebooted at ~17:56 EST
- All 6 services came back automatically
- Context recovered from turnover letter + memory files
- Chrome opened Facebook without intervention
- GNOME keyring came back via PAM — fixed by cleaning PAM entries (won't recur)

## Pending / Waiting

- **Seasoned Facebook account** — 12-13 year aged account + dedicated residential IP incoming in 1-2 days. DO NOT log into Facebook from OC6 machine until it arrives. Zero risk until then.
- **Gmail login** — Grant needs to log into Google account in Chrome (~3 min). Opens full Google ecosystem.
- **Veron SSH** — OC6 public key needs to be added to Veron's (10.10.0.6) authorized_keys

---

## Capabilities Executive Summary (from audit)

### CAN do autonomously:
- Navigate any website headlessly via Playwright
- Take desktop screenshots (scrot)
- Inject mouse/keyboard via xdotool
- SSH into all 6 fleet machines
- Hit AntiGravity REST API
- Open VS Code and edit code
- Install system packages (sudo NOPASSWD)
- Browse Facebook/Reddit/TikTok/X (logged out, public content)

### CANNOT do without human assist:
- Create social media accounts (CAPTCHA + phone SMS verify)
- Log into Gmail/Facebook (no saved credentials yet)
- SSH into Veron (no authorized_keys entry)

## Key Lessons from Today

1. **gnome-keyring has TWO start mechanisms** — systemd service (now masked) AND PAM hook. Both must be disabled.
2. **x11vnc as raw process = fragile** — convert to systemd service with Restart=always
3. **WiFi power save = primary cause of going offline** — radio sleeps and drops connection. Fix: nmcli connection modify, powersave=2
4. **Mystery full-screen window (0x12005c5)** — XFCE sometimes creates an invisible full-screen InputOutput window that intercepts all clicks. Kill with `xdotool windowclose <id>`
5. **OC3 uses `sneakyfree` username** — not `thewindstorm`. Easy to miss.
6. **Linger=yes is critical** — without it, user services die when display session ends
